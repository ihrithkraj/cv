<h2 class="first">1.Diabetes</h2>

<div class="first-first" >

   
<p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.</p>

    <h2 class="first">2. Breast Cancer </h2>
    <div class="second-first" >

   
    <p>Breast cancer happens when cells in your breast grow and divide in an uncontrolled way, creating a mass of tissue called a tumor. Signs of breast cancer can include feeling a lump in your breast, experiencing a change in the size of your breast and seeing changes to the skin on your breast. Mammograms can help with early detection.<br></p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>

    <div class="second-third">

    <p>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>
      <li>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast
      </li>
      <li>
        Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling
      </li>
      <li>
        A newly inverted nipple
      </li>
      <li>Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin</li>
      <li>Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange</li>
    </ul>
  </div>




    <div class="second-fourth">
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>Doctors know that breast cancer occurs when some breast cells begin to grow abnormally. These cells divide more rapidly than healthy cells do and continue to accumulate, forming a lump or mass. Cells may spread (metastasize) through your breast to your lymph nodes or to other parts of your body.<br>
Breast cancer most often begins with cells in the milk-producing ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Breast cancer may also begin in the glandular tissue called lobules (invasive lobular carcinoma) or in other cells or tissue within the breast.
<br>
Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.</p>

Heart valve disease<br>
Disease of the heart muscle<br>

<h2 class="first">4.Parkinsons disease </h2>
<div class="fourth">

   
<p>Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement.
In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.
Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms. Occasionally, your doctor may suggest surgery to regulate certain regions of your brain and improve your symptoms.<br></p>
</div>


<div class="fourth-first">
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
</div>




<div class="fourth-second">
<p>Classic symptoms of this disease include:</p>
 <ul>
  <li><b>Tremor.</b> A tremor, or shaking, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth, known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest.</li>
  <li><b>Slowed movement (bradykinesia)</b>. Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you walk. It may be difficult to get out of a chair. You may drag your feet as you try to walk.</li>
  <li><b>Rigid muscles.</b> Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body. The stiff muscles can be painful and limit your range of motion.</li>
  <li><b>Impaired posture and balance.</b> Your posture may become stooped, or you may have balance problems as a result of Parkinson's disease.</li>
  <li><b> Loss of automatic movements.</b>< You may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk.</li>
